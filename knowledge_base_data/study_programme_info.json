After completing this study programme, graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Mathematics (BMath) degree, they have open access to the labour market, and they are also capable of enrolling in graduate study programmes in mathematics and its various specific fields as well as graduate study programmes in other fields that require good foundations of mathematics and computer science knowledge. By its syllabus, as well as the forms and methods of teaching, the study programme enables adoption and understanding of: the basic knowledge of major areas of mathematics, and the basic knowledge of computer science. During their study, BMath degree holders also develop the following competencies: practical application of acquired knowledge in mathematics and computer science, and solving problems in other (not necessarily mathematical) areas by applying mathematical models and computers. Forms and methods of teaching contribute to the development of: the learning ability and inclination to scientific research, communication and presentation skills.

The main goal of such a program is to form a study program that will better prepare students for the labor market in IT, perhaps the fastest growing branch of industry in the Republic of Croatia. The study program of the undergraduate university study of Mathematics and Computing is unique in its structure and content of the course precisely due to the fact that it combines knowledge and skills from two areas, mathematics and computing. The structure of the proposed study program is motivated by undergraduate Computer Science studies from the University of Saarland, Saarbruecken, and the University of Stuttgart.\n\n",

The programme is carefully balanced between advanced mathematical theories and practical skills which makes it unique in Croatia. Financial mathematics studies the problems of financial decision making by combining different techniques from theoretical and applied mathematics. Market and credit risk management, investment strategies, fund management and insurance risks management are impossible without mathematical models. Graduates of this programme are regularly employed in challenging and well-paid jobs in banks, insurance companies, pension funds, financial institutions, audit firms and as data analysts. This study is ideal for anyone who has skills for analytical problem solving and is willing to make an effort to acquire new knowledge that will enable them a promising business career. Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics, I can assure you that mine are still greater. (Albert Einstein) Enrolling in the study programme of Financial Mathematics and Statistics is an investment in a successful future - all the effort invested brings multiple benefits!\n\n",
